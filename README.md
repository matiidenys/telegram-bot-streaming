# telegram-bot-streaming

This is my Bachelor's project. 

It runs on Python 3.9,  and it uses ffmpeg for rendering the videos and streams. 

Telethon was used as framework for Telegram API.

This bot allows you to turn on or off streaming to your selected social medias. 

You can not only re-translate on-going streams, but also stream a specific video.

You are not limited to the social medias I have added, but you can add any other rtmps address. 

The project was originally created per the request of C4 TV Channel during my summer practice in university and later on it was improved to be qualified as graduating bachelor degree project.
